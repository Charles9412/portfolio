# SafeDriveAI 🚗🧠

**Smart AI-Powered Safety Assistant for Teens and Parents**

SafeDriveAI is an early-stage project designed to help reduce drunk driving and improve safety for young people—especially during weekends and high-risk nights. By combining AI-based image and speech detection models with mobile integration, the system aims to alert, intervene, or guide users away from dangerous behavior.
