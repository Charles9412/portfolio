# 🧠 Portfolio: Machine Learning & Data Projects

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases a curated selection of machine learning experiments, modeling pipelines, and data visualizations that I’ve developed.

## 🤖 ML Projects

Each subfolder in this repository contains a self-contained project or experiment. These include classification models, regression pipelines, prediction surfaces, and exploratory notebooks.

> Projects included:
- 📁 `card_classifier`: A DNN-based image classifier for recognizing card types.
- 📁 `fifa_svm_experiments`: SVM experiments using FIFA player stats to model clustering and performance.
- 📁 `mlr_class`: Multivariate regression and variable selection for medical datasets.
- 📁 `prediction_surface`: Visualizing prediction boundaries and surfaces for various ML models.
- 📁 `SafeDriveAI` *(WIP)*: An AI-based prototype for promoting safer driving behavior using computer vision.
